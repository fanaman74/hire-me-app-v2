# CLAUDE.md

This file provides project-level context for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What This Is

A local React + Express console built around 9 Claude Code slash-command prompts that turn an LLM into a multi-agent job search system. The original prompt architecture remains in `.claude/commands/`; the web console loads those prompts and sends them through the OpenRouter chat completions API using the model selected in Settings.

## Web Application

- Frontend: React + Vite in `src/`
- Local API: Express in `server/`
- Settings: `.data/settings.json` (Git ignored) or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- OpenRouter catalog: `GET /api/v1/models`
- OpenRouter runs: `POST /api/v1/chat/completions`

Never send an OpenRouter key to the frontend. All OpenRouter requests must continue to pass through the local server. The model used for agent runs must come from the persisted settings store rather than a UI-only default.

Users clone the repo, drop in a resume, and run commands. Everything else is generated.

## Data Model

All candidate data lives **outside** this repo in `~/job-search-candidates/` (configurable). Each candidate gets an isolated workspace:

```
~/job-search-candidates/
└── {candidate-slug}/
    ├── resume-base.md              # Source-of-truth resume
    ├── search-config.yaml          # Search preferences and filters
    ├── found-jobs.json             # Cumulative job ledger (append-only)
    ├── candidate-profile.json      # Structured profile (auto-generated)
    ├── tailored-resumes/           # All tailored resumes across runs
    ├── applications/               # Submitted application tracking
    ├── reports/                    # Exported stats reports
    └── runs/                       # Search run output folders
        └── run-{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM}/
            ├── FINAL-REPORT.md     # Primary deliverable per run
            ├── run-meta.json       # Run configuration and stats
            ├── agent-{N}-results.json  # Per-agent search results
            ├── summary.md          # Results table
            └── {company}_{role}/   # Per-job application package
                ├── job-details.md
                ├── instructions.md
                ├── resume-tailored.md
                └── cover-letter.md
```

## Command Chain

The intended workflow order:

| # | Command | Purpose |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | `/setup-candidate` | Bootstrap a candidate workspace from a resume |
| 2 | `/build-search-config` | Auto-generate search preferences from resume analysis |
| 3 | `/find-me-a-job` | Spawn parallel agents to search, score, and package jobs |
| 4 | `/add-job` | Manually add a job from a URL and generate full application package |
| 5 | `/write-cover-letter` | Generate a tailored cover letter for a specific job |
| 6 | `/export-resume` | Convert a tailored resume markdown to .docx |
| 7 | `/mark-submitted` | Update application status in the ledger |
| 8 | `/job-stats` | Pipeline stats, weekly activity, and unemployment reporting data |
| 9 | `/interview-prep` | Interview prep document, interactive mock interviews, or post-interview debrief |

## Conventions

- **Append-only ledger.** `found-jobs.json` is never overwritten from scratch — only appended to. Runs accumulate over time.
- **Isolated agent writes.** During `/find-me-a-job`, each search agent writes to its own `agent-{N}-results.json`. The lead coordinator merges all results after agents complete.
- **Files, not terminal.** Long-form output (reports, resumes, cover letters, prep docs) is always written to files. Terminal output is limited to short status messages.
- **Copy, never move.** Original files (resumes, configs) are preserved when copied into the workspace.
- **Nothing is ever deleted.** Previous run folders persist. The ledger grows across runs.

## Default Paths

- **Candidate data root:** `~/job-search-candidates/` (configurable via `--root` in `/setup-candidate`)
- **DOCX conversion script:** `./scripts/md-to-docx.py` (requires `pip3 install python-docx`)

## Dependencies

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — the CLI tool that executes these commands
- Python 3 + `python-docx` — only needed for `/export-resume`
